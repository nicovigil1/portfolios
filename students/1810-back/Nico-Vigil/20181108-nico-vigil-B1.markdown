## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to grow personally and spiritually as I learned more in 7 months than
I had ever thought possible. So far I would say that I am right on track, as I
have grown in ways that I didn't even know to be possible.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

The largest thing I struggled with this module was the adjustment from rural to
city life. I had always thought myself to be a city person at heart, but when I
actually moved to Denver I had this immense fear of falling flat on my face.
Previously I had always seen myself as adaptable to any situation, but over the
course of my first month here I began to call that into question.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I truly enjoyed the Black Thursday project due to the lovable people that I was
paired with. It was a joy every day to sit down and try and figure out the
impossible. My least favorite to work on was battleship, as I did not have as
firm of a grasp of ruby as I would have liked to have before I went into a group
project.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned a lot about ruby and embracing challenges.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned a lot about the value of working with different types of people with
different working styles.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I didn't do near as much has I would have liked, however I did foster
relationships that I look forward to (hopefully) carrying with me for the rest
my life.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to contribute to an inclusive community that fosters a safe space
for learning.
